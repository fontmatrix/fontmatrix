_PIERRE_

* FIXES:
  - performance issues
  - usability issues
  - ugly code
  - render glyphs with Freetype, Qt doesn’t handle it very well :(
  - split main window into View and Data (or whatever it’s called by actual developers;-)
  - change left pane into a docked widget
   
* BACKEND:
  - replace fontmatrix backend (activation / deactivation,
    tags database, etc.) with a third party one or even write 
    this more general purpose font management library in order
    to focus on presentation in fontmatrix itself.

* FEATURES:
  - continue to listen Vlada!
  - Write an up to date help page

* MISC:
  - tweak fontmatrix.desktop file to make correct menu entery

* UI:
  - draw nice icons for zoom
  - make Info, Tags, Glyphs etc. icons

* WEB:
  - mockup site
  - make it!
